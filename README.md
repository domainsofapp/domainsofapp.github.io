## README for code repository: domainsofapp.github.io

This code repository hosts the data for my personal experimental filter blog: Domains of Applicability

Domains of Applicability can be found at: domainsofapp.github.io

The design of this repository is modeled after Ref. [1].

Whenever I push changes to this repository on my local computer to GitHub, the data herein is automatically transformed by Jekyll [2] into the static site that you see at the above URL.

I am using Markdown to write the posts.
