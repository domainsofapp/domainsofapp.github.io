# README for Code Repository "domainsofapp.github.io"

This code repository hosts the data for my personal experimental Internet filter blog: Domains of Applicability. The website is primarily targeted for my own personal access, use, and reference across multiple Internet-connected devices and machines.

Domains of Applicability can be found at the following URL:

https://domainsofapp.github.io/

The above link is free with my free GitHub account and repository.

See more: GitHub Pages

I used to pay ~$10/year to register and own the following custom domain in the Domain Name System (DNS):

https://www.domainsofapplicability.com/

Originally, the first link above (GitHub Pages) redirected to the second b/c I paid for the second (b/c I like the name). I have stopped paying so the second URL no longer works--please use the first URL.

The design of this README and repository is modeled after Ref. [1].

When I push changes to this repository on my local computer to GitHub, the data herein is automatically transformed by Jekyll [2] into the static site you see at the first URL above.

I am using Markdown to write the posts.

I used to implement Google Analytics on the site; I removed it to keep the site simpler (also, because I have no need to track information about site viewers).
