Italics mine:

"Some have suggested (Cartwright 1999, Hacking 1983) a picture of science according to which there are no systematic relations that hold between different models. Some models are tied together because they represent the same target system, but this does not imply that they enter into any further relationships (deductive or otherwise). We are confronted with a patchwork of models, all of which hold ceteris paribus in their specific _domains of applicability_."

The physicist and philosopher Sean Carroll has used the term "Domains of Applicability" on his blog, The Preposterous Universe, and has elaborated on the concept in a few of his talks (e.g., see links in the Physics section of this blog).

In other words, there is no "theory of everything" and the pursuit of such is absurd. There are only models that work best in their specific "domains of applicability".
