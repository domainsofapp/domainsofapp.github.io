Rhetoric is bad. Avoid it like the plague.

Publish, publish, and publish.

Publish useful stuff (within the confines of legality).

Don't be afraid. Dive right in.

Follow your compulsions while deciding to be good. Your compulsions are unique and not the same as others'.

In any task, do only what is necessary.

[!!!Cliché Warning!!!] If you had one year left to live, what would you do right now?

When there is (attractive) magnetism it is clear and you will know it. Sometimes the polarity changes during one’s lifetime and that's life.

Seek to achieve/accomplish 1000 failures, and you will have 1 success; failure is the necessary and difficult road to success.

Put something back in the place where you first looked for it. It's always in the last place you look.

Everything is going to be O-K, <insert your name or someone else's>.

One blog post/Git commit per day.

The pain is real. The struggle is real.

Don't be a <insert_curse_word>.

Pursue hobbies according to your heroes -- there's a good reason you are interested in them as people.

Success is relative to happiness.

Never boast -- you will eat your words.

Short version: If anything in life is easy, you're doing it wrong. Long version: If anything in life is easy, you are either doing it sub-optimally or you have already learned how to do it optimally.

Strive for excellence. Whether you achieve it or not does not matter.

Self-immerse in culture.

Attempt to distribute heartfelt love in every action.

Don't strive to be an attractive human; strive to be an attractive skeleton.

Unleash the power of the brain.

Strive for continuous improvement; it is good enough for all intents and purposes.

The best engineer is completely replaceable by a human; even better, by an algorithm. Thus, an engineer should strive for self-automation. Write the engineering specification of yourself.

For every task, first define the "measure of success".

MYOB (and BYOB): Mind your own business (and, while you're at it, bring your own beer).

Use the Oxford comma. It is more professional, accurate, and precise. (Later _todo: Turn this life mantra into an Oxford comma pun. Any ideas?)


Always check first if the milk is spoiled or else you shall greatly regret it. (This advice applies not only to gastrointestinal issues but also on a broad scale including in relationships.)

Shave with cold water. I know--it's counterintuitive. Heck, while we're at it, floss the teeth you wish to keep, and wear sunscreen.

For every file you create/add, process and delete another one.

Yea, it sucks. So it goes; such is life. Keep truckin'. Forge onward; venture upward--whatever that means to you (and you alone).

Think before you act. Will this action hurt someone? If so, try a different approach. Think before you speak. Will these words hurt someone? If so, rephrase it.

Don't sh!t where you eat. (e.g., Avoid dating colleagues, housemates, apartment mates, etc.). Heck, while we're at it, avoid nicotine/tobacco and credit card debt like the plague. The latter sentence has words of advice told to me when I was young. I am grateful for them, and I have always kept them in mind.
