Follow your compulsions, while deciding to be good. Your compulsions are unique and not the same as others'.  

Publish useful stuff (if compelled to, and within the confines of legality).  

Do not be afraid. Dive right in.  

In any critical task, attempt to do only what is necessary.  

Life is not hard if you be yourself. --F.A. (personal conversation)
