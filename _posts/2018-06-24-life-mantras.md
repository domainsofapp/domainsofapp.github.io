...aka me (as an adult) talking to myself as a kid.

Rhetoric is bad. Avoid it like the plague.

Publish, publish, and publish. Also, broadcast culture. Download it; copy it; burn, press, and print it to hard/physical/tangible/not-just-digital media; distribute it; share it with others; preserve it. Play music out loud in order to gain perspective--both the different sounds (e.g., vs. headphones) and the possibility of others hearing it may change your opinion about a song.

Publish useful stuff (within the confines of legality).

Don't be afraid. Dive right in.

Follow your compulsions while deciding to be good. Your compulsions are unique and not the same as others'.

In any task, do only what is necessary.

[Cliché Warning] If you had one year left to live, what would you do right now?

When there is (attractive) magnetism between people, it is clear, and you will know it--just like how two magnets with opposite poles "know it" and attract. Sometimes--just like what happens with the magnetic poles on Earth--the polarity switches during one’s lifetime, and that is one of the many sad inevitabilities of biological life on Earth (and perhaps elsewhere also and again not limited to "living" organisms).

Seek to achieve/accomplish 1000 failures, and you will have 1 success. Failure is the necessary and difficult road to success.

Put something back in the place where you first looked for it. Also: It is always in the last place you look.

Everything is going to be O-K, <insert your or someone else's name>.

One blog post/Git commit per day.

The pain is real. The struggle is real.

Don't be a <insert_curse_word>.

Pursue hobbies and interests according to your heroes/role models/inspirations, and consider adopting their (ideally good) traits and mannerisms--there is a good reason you are interested in them as people.

Success is relative to happiness.

Never boast (unless you are hungry)--you will eat your words.

If anything in life is easy, you are doing it wrong. (More realistically, if anything in life is easy, you are either doing it sub-optimally, or you have already learned how to do it optimally.)

Strive for excellence. Whether you achieve it or not does not matter. 'Tis the strive that counts.

Self-immerse in culture.

Attempt to emenate heartfelt love in every action.

Don't strive to be an attractive human; strive to be an attractive skeleton.

Unleash the power of the brain.

Strive for continuous improvement; it is good enough for all intents and purposes.

The best engineer is completely replaceable by another human; even better, by an algorithm. Thus, an engineer should strive for self-automation. Write the engineering specification of yourself (what you do in your job/career).

For every task, first define the "measure of success".

MYOB (and BYOB): Mind your own business (and, while you're at it, bring your own beer).

Use the Oxford comma. It is more professional, accurate and precise. See, doesn't that bother you, too?

Always check first if the milk is spoiled or else you shall greatly regret it later. If it is, dump it before you get hurt. (And, do it the responsible and clean way so the carton doesn't turn to rot and attract flies.)

Shave with cold water. I know--it's counterintuitive. Heck, while we're at it, floss the teeth you wish to keep, and wear sunscreen.

For every file you create/add, process and delete another one.

Yea, it sucks. So it goes. Such is life. Keep truckin'. Forge onward. Venture upward--whatever that means to you (and you alone).

Think before you act. Will this action hurt someone? If so, try a different approach. Think before you speak. Will these words hurt someone? If so, rephrase it.

Don't sh!t where you eat. (Avoid dating colleagues, roommates/housemates/apartmentmates, etc.). While we're at it, avoid both nicotine/tobacco and credit card debt like the plague. Someone told me the latter when I was a kid--I want to pay it forward.

Do. Every. Single. Thing. For. Yourself. Align your goals with helping and doing good for others. Take. Care. Of. Yourself.

You get what you measure.

If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Say the Programmer's Prayer when needed: Please, God, help me solve this bug.

When all else fails--when you hit a mental block--try a Parallax view.

Focus your adult life on remembering what you liked and returning to who you were as a kid. As you grow up, you will forget this (or perhaps actively displace it from the memory out of rebellious rejection and thinking it must be uncool--in fact, arguably it is your most true, real, unfiltered, unique, individualistic, and actually cool self!).

No FOMO: You have missed out (e.g., before you were born); you are missing out (e.g., while you are alive); and, you always will miss out (e.g., after you are dead). For any given event, there are at least 100 of the same happening elsewhere at the same time. At every moment, focus on the here and the now--what feels right to you. Never seek nor fear to miss out.

Sh!t happens. Life goes on.

Regarding matters of trivial concern: If you ignore something, it will go away.

Never look up matters of health online (on the Internet). If you do, you will find out that you have the very worst type of irreversible and untreatable condition (which you do not; and, even if you do, see above life mantra: Everything will be O-K, <insert your or someone else's name>).

Two-week rule: Give every health issue of moderate concern two weeks. If you are still thinking about it at that point, schedule an appointment to talk to a professional (for peace of mind if nothing else).

15-minute rule: Let a child cry for 15-minutes before attending to them. (Of course, monitor the situation in the meantime.) It teaches discipline (a quality that is greatly lacking in this modern world).

I double dog dare you not to ever complain to anyone about any issue no matter how large or small you perceive it to be; rather, report it to a professional who can actually help the problem that you may or may not have. Turn every would-be complaint into a professional reporting process (as well as a learning experience).

Do not let perfect be the enemy of good. It is well beyond 80%. Ship it. Fix it later as needed.

You are going to get through this even if you are all on your own.

It is one (bad) thing to be an a-hole; it is altogether another to be a scumbag. Avoid any hint of scumbagggery at all times like the plague.

Never accept a job (if/when switching jobs) without a sign-on bonus especially in the middle of a calendar year. The tax burden (i.e., effort, time, and cost) alone of switching jobs requires it.

Nothing on the outside ultimately matters (your skin, your bones, your teeth, your mobility, &c.). Only your brain matters. Do everything you can to protect your brain and you can get by no matter what happens to your physical body.

Try to never leave Git unsynced. You may lose your computer (and your work in the process).

Attempt to channel original thoughts into useful published form (e.g., in the real-world "meatspace", e.g., participation in plays, open mic sessions, freestyle raps, or in the digital "cyberspace", e.g., publication to GitHub, SoundCloud, etc.). We are mere tools of consciousness; vectors to publication of unique thoughts and cultural proliferation.

Nothing matters except human decency and passing the boredom each day (and thereby not losing your sanity). Relentlessly pursue (albeit ultimately, entirely meaningless) life goals in order to stave off boredom. Eat enough to sleep each night.

Be as simple and clear as possible in your writing. Use Simple English when possible.
