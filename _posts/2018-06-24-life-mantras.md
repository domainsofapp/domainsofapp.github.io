Follow your compulsions while deciding to be good. Your compulsions are unique and not the same as others'.

Publish useful stuff (within the confines of legality).

Publish, publish, publish.

Don't be afraid. Dive right in.

In any task, do only what is necessary.

If you had one year left to live what would you do right now?

When there is (attractive) magnetism it is clear and you will know it. Sometimes the polarity changes during oneâ€™s lifetime and that's life.

Seek to achieve/accomplish 1000 failures, and you will have 1 success; failure is the necessary and difficult road to success.

Put something back in the place where you first looked for it. It's always in the last place you look.

Everything is going to be O-K, <insert your name or someone else's>.

One blog post/Git commit per day.

The pain is real. The struggle is real.

Don't be a <insert_curse_word>.

Pursue hobbies according to your heroes -- there's a good reason you are interested in them as people.
