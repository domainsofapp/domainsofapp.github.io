...aka me (as an adult) talking to myself as a kid.

Rhetoric is bad. Avoid it like the plague.

Publish, publish, and publish. Also, broadcast culture. Download it; copy it; burn, press, and print it to hard/physical/tangible/not-just-digital media; distribute it; share it with others; preserve it. Play music out loud--both the different sounds (e.g., vs. headphones) and the possibility of others hearing it may change your opinion about a song.

Publish useful stuff (within the confines of legality).

Don't be afraid. Dive right in.

Follow your compulsions while deciding to be good. Your compulsions are unique and not the same as others'.

In any task, do only what is necessary.

[Cliché Warning] If you had one year left to live, what would you do right now?

When there is (attractive) magnetism between people, it is clear, and you will know it. Sometimes the polarity changes during one’s lifetime, and that is one of the many sad inevitabilities of biological life on Earth (and perhaps elsewhere also).

Seek to achieve/accomplish 1000 failures, and you will have 1 success. Failure is the necessary and difficult road to success.

Put something back in the place where you first looked for it. Also: It is always in the last place you look.

Everything is going to be O-K, <insert your name or someone else's>.

One blog post/Git commit per day.

The pain is real. The struggle is real.

Don't be a <insert_curse_word>.

Pursue hobbies and interests according to your heroes/role models/inspirations, and consider adopting their (ideally good) traits and mannerisms--there is a good reason you are interested in them as people.

Success is relative to happiness.

Never boast--you will eat your words.

If anything in life is easy, you are doing it wrong. (More realistically, if anything in life is easy, you are either doing it sub-optimally, or you have already learned how to do it optimally.)

Strive for excellence. Whether you achieve it or not does not matter. 'Tis the striving that counts.

Self-immerse in culture.

Attempt to emenate heartfelt love in every action.

Don't strive to be an attractive human; strive to be an attractive skeleton.

Unleash the power of the brain.

Strive for continuous improvement; it is good enough for all intents and purposes.

The best engineer is completely replaceable by another human; even better, by an algorithm. Thus, an engineer should strive for self-automation. Write the engineering specification of yourself (what you do in your job/career).

For every task, first define the "measure of success".

MYOB (and BYOB): Mind your own business (and, while you're at it, bring your own beer).

Use the Oxford comma. It is more professional, accurate and precise. See, doesn't that bother you, too?

Always check first if the milk is spoiled or else you shall greatly regret it later. (This advice applies not only to gastrointestinal issues caused by milk but also on a broader scale including to relationships which incidentally can also lead to gastrointestinal issues, so, like the good doctor says: For a happy tummy, read, listen to, and act on the advice, dummy!)

Shave with cold water. I know--it's counterintuitive. Heck, while we're at it, floss the teeth you wish to keep, and wear sunscreen.

For every file you create/add, process and delete another one.

Yea, it sucks. So it goes. Such is life. Keep truckin'. Forge onward. Venture upward--whatever that means to you (and you alone).

Think before you act. Will this action hurt someone? If so, try a different approach. Think before you speak. Will these words hurt someone? If so, rephrase it.

Don't sh!t where you eat. (Both literally and also, e.g., avoid dating colleagues, roommates/housemates/apartmentmates, etc.). Heck, while we're at it, avoid both nicotine/tobacco and credit card debt like the plague. Someone told me the latter when I was a kid, and I am grateful for it (and thus wish to pay it forward).

This is perhaps the saddest, most tragic, and most difficult life lesson to learn--it is almost the modern-day coming of age moment to finally accept/succumb to it; also, the key to modern-day basic minimum viable/sustainable contentedness: Do. Every. Single. Thing. For. Yourself. And. No. One. Else. Feel like doing something? Do it. (Pending ethics, morality, legality, etc.). Don't let others--not even (or perhaps especially not) significant others--distract you from this perpetual pursuit/drive. To overcome your desire for shared experiences, pretend others are simulations of The Void whence we came, where we live, where we shall return, and all there is. Believe it or not and like it or not, you are fundamentally alone in The Universe. However, your actions can impact others. Ideally some or even much of what you do affects others in a positive way. Strive for this. And, well, if you do this, then that is all there is. You did it! You did good things! [And, when it comes to relationships in the modern world, here is the trick: The microsecond you express interest (enough to be detected), your cover is blown--the other party loses interest without fail, and it is solo hasta luego from there, mi señor compañero solo. It is the absurd mating dance of the human species of the modern world. It is selfish as all Hell, but the only way to achieve modern relations is to heed this advice and think of absolutely nothing except yourself at all times like a brute while (if you are luckily intelligent enough and not actually a brute and still able to do all this so far) secretly caring about the other party.
