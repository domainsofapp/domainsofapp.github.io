Follow your compulsions while deciding to be good. Your compulsions are unique and not the same as others'.

Publish useful stuff (if compelled to and within the confines of legality).

Don't be afraid. Dive right in.

In any critical task attempt to do only what is necessary.

Life is not hard if you be yourself. --F.A. (personal conversation)

If you had one year left to live what would you do right now?

When there is (attractive) magnetism it is clear and you will know it. Sometimes the polarity changes during oneâ€™s lifetime and that's life.

Achieve/accomplish 1000 failures and you will have 1 success; failure is the necessary but difficult road to success.
