...aka me (as an adult) talking to myself as a kid.

Rhetoric is bad. Avoid it like the plague.

Publish, publish, and publish. Also, broadcast culture. Download it; copy it; burn, press, and print it to hard/physical/tangible/not-just-digital media; distribute it; share it with others; preserve it. Play music out loud in order to gain perspective--both the different sounds (e.g., vs. headphones) and the possibility of others hearing it may change your opinion about a song.

Publish useful stuff (within the confines of legality).

Don't be afraid. Dive right in.

Follow your compulsions while deciding to be good. Your compulsions are unique and not the same as others'.

In any task, do only what is necessary.

!!Cliché Warning!! If you had one year left to live, what would you do right now?

When there is (attractive) magnetism between people, it is clear, and you'll know it--just like how two magnets with opposite poles "know it" and attract. Sometimes--just like what happens with the magnetic poles on Earth--the polarity switches during one’s lifetime, and that is one of the many sad inevitabilities of biological life on Earth (and perhaps elsewhere also and again not limited to "living" organisms).

Seek to achieve/accomplish 1,000 failures, and you'll have one success. Failure is the necessary and difficult road to success.

Put something back in the place where you first looked for it. Also: It's always in the last place you look.

Everything is going to be O-K, <<insert your or someone else's name>>.

One blog post per day. One Git commit per day.

The pain is real. The struggle is real.

Don't be a <<insert_curse_word>>.

Pursue hobbies and interests according to your heroes/role models/inspirations, and consider adopting their (ideally good) traits and mannerisms--there is a good reason you are interested in them as people.

Success is relative to happiness.

Never boast (unless you're hungry)--you'll eat your words.

If anything in life is easy, you're doing it wrong. (More realistically, if anything in life is easy, you're either doing it sub-optimally, or you've already learned how to do it optimally.)

Strive for excellence. Whether you achieve it or not does not matter. 'Tis the strive that counts.

Self-immerse in culture.

Attempt to emenate heartfelt love in every action.

Don't strive to be an attractive human; strive to be an attractive skeleton.

Unleash the power of the brain.

Strive for continuous improvement; it is good enough for all intents and purposes.

The best engineer is completely replaceable by another human; even better, by an algorithm. Thus, an engineer should strive for self-automation. Write the engineering specification of yourself (what you do in your job).

For every task, first define the "measure of success".

MYOB (and BYOB): Mind your own business (and, while you're at it, bring your own dang beer).

Use the Oxford comma. It is more professional, accurate and precise. See, doesn't that bother you, too?

Always check first if the milk is spoiled or else you shall greatly regret it later. If it is, dump it before you get hurt. (And, do it the responsible and clean way so the carton doesn't turn to rot and attract flies.)

Shave with cold water. I know--it's counterintuitive. Heck, while we're at it, floss the teeth you wish to keep, and wear sunscreen.

For every file you create/add, process and delete another one.

Yea, it sucks. So it goes. Such is life. Keep truckin'. Forge onward. Venture upward--whatever that means to you (and you alone).

Think before you act. Will this action hurt someone? If so, try a different approach. Think before you speak. Will these words hurt someone? If so, rephrase it.

Don't sh!t where you eat. (Avoid dating colleagues, roommates/housemates/apartmentmates, etc.). While we're at it, avoid both nicotine/tobacco and credit card debt like the plague. Someone told me the latter when I was a kid--I want to pay it forward.

Do. Every. Single. Thing. For. Yourself. Align your goals with helping and doing good for others. Take. Care. Of. Yourself. (Put on your oxygen mask, & then get to helping others.)

You get what you measure.

Say the Programmer's Prayer when needed: Please, J0d, help me solve this bug.

When all else fails--when you hit a mental block--try a Parallax view (i.e., looking at something through an entirely different ideological framework).

Focus your adult life on remembering what you liked and returning to who you were as a kid. As you grow up, you'll forget this (or perhaps actively displace it from the memory out of rebellious rejection and thinking it must be uncool--in fact, arguably it is your most true, real, unfiltered, unique, individualistic, and actually cool self!).

No FOMO: Have no Fear of Missing Out, for you already have missed out (e.g., before you were born); you are missing out (e.g., while you are alive); and, you always will miss out (e.g., after you are dead). For any given event, there are at least 100 of the same happening elsewhere at the same time. At every moment, focus on the here and the now--what feels good, just, and right to you. Neither seek nor fear to miss out.

Sh!t happens. Life goes on.

Regarding matters of trivial concern: If you ignore something, it will go away.

Never look up matters of health online (on the Internet). If you do, you'll find out that you have the very worst type of irreversible and untreatable condition (which you do not; and, even if you do, see above life mantra: Everything will be O-K, <<insert your or someone else's name>>).

Two-week rule: Give every health issue of moderate concern two weeks. If you are still thinking about it at that point, schedule an appointment to talk to a professional (for peace of mind if nothing else).

15-minute rule: Let a child cry for 15-minutes before attending to them. (Of course, monitor the situation in the meantime.) It teaches discipline (a quality that is greatly lacking in this modern world).

I double dog dare you not to ever complain to anyone about any issue no matter how large or small you perceive it to be; rather, report it to a professional who can actually help the problem that you may or may not have. Turn every would-be complaint into a professional reporting process (as well as a learning experience).

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. It's already at or beyond 80%. Ship it. Fix it later as needed.

You're going to get through it even if you're all on your own.

It is one (bad) thing to be an a-hole; it is altogether another to be a scumbag. Avoid any hint of scumbagggery at all times like the plague.

Never accept a job (if/when switching jobs) without a sign-on bonus especially in the middle of a calendar year. The tax burden (i.e., effort, time, and cost) alone of switching jobs requires it.

Nothing on the outside ultimately matters (your skin, your bones, your teeth, your mobility, &c.). Only your brain matters. Do everything you can to protect your brain and you can get by no matter what happens to your physical body. Of course, when your body ultimately breaks down, you're done for (incl. your brain).

Try to never leave Git unsynced to the cloud repository. You may lose your computer (and your work in the process).

Attempt to channel original thoughts into useful published form (e.g., in the real-world "meatspace", e.g., participation in plays, open mic sessions, freestyle raps, or in the digital "cyberspace", e.g., publication to GitHub, SoundCloud, etc.). We are mere tools of consciousness; vectors to publication of unique thoughts and cultural proliferation (incl. in spoken word).

Nothing matters. In times when facing anxiety or depression, remember that nothing ultimately matters except human decency and passing the boredom each day and thereby not losing your sanity. Relentlessly pursue (albeit ultimately, entirely meaningless) life goals in order to stave off boredom. When possible, eat enough to be able to sleep each night.

Be as simple and clear as possible in your writing. Use Simple English when possible.

Always give credit where credit is due (essential ethical and moral code; if you ever take credit for anything that is not yours, you're a sc****bag).

Rearrange your room/apartment/house/domicile everyday; this is one of the many, natural psychological medications prescribed by the Situationist International (SI) movement and philosophy.

The only reason you care about anything bad that happens to you in life is because you are afraid of your own mortality (i.e., your vastly limited life and impending death). Lose your fear of mortality, and you'll be able to face anything bad that happens to you in life. Like the speed of light is to velocity, death is the ultimate "bad" event to happen to you (because once you are dead, no Earthly matter matters anymore). And, just like a person who is experiencing and living light-speed first-hand sees time come to a stop, the person who manages to live without fear of mortality sees the occurrence of insurmountably "bad" events come to a full stop and is able to overcome everything regardless of what it is and continue to move forward.

At all times, before doing anything, close your eyes and roll them to the back of your brain. Think and feel to yourself: "What do I want to do right now?" So long as that thing is socially acceptable and whatnot, do it. Roll your own conciousness back onto itself; like Inception, always think on a meta-level (think about your own thinking; constructively criticize your own modes and outputs of thinking).

Bad times suck. However, the worst times are also the greatest fuel for artistic creation (music, fiction writing, etc.). Channel the worst of times in this productive way.

Exercise your imagination to the fullest potential. It is the most powerful thing you can do with your brain/consciousness/mind.

Everything in life that can go wrong, will go wrong, so try to prepare for it if possible. Accept this principle as the premise of your life in every second of every day, especially in the times when absolutely everything is falling apart around you. If possible, best to prepare for the worst in every moment.

Build tools around workflows, not workflows around tools. Credit not mine. Source: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24244329>

Be present, but fly under the radar at all times (out of a safety concern for your own self).

As a rule, never look up yourself ("egosurfing") or others on the Internet. Never "surf" without purpose. Do everything for a specific purpose driven by your mind, even if "everything" is nothing because your mind does not feel like doing anything.

Train your mind to operate on three concurrent paths at all times: 1.) the here and now, 2.) the immediate next step, and 3.) making sure #1 and #2 are all there ever is.

F--k you. Pay me.

Wait two weeks to report any medical, dental, etc. issue to a professional (doctor, dentist, etc.).

Return to your child-state. Try to embrace games, puzzles, and riddles.

If you don't wish to be judged for your vulnerabilities, or you're just tired of it all, be alone forever. That doesn't sound like much fun, though.

It’s water under the bridge: When you regret something but cannot change it, figure out the lesson(s) to be learned as quickly as possible, and then immediately forget about everything except the valuable lesson(s). Try to never repeat the mistake. You are human and will make mistakes. This is the best you can do after the fact (it is what you can do to make up for the mistake).

How to prioritize: Ask yourself, "If I were to croak right here and now, what would make people shake their heads and say, 'He should have done or had this, *tisk tisk*, SMH,' or, 'If only he had (or had not) done that,' and so on. Now try to fill those gaps so they won't be able to say it.

I prefer "missed" to "lost". Many things in life are lost but not all are missed after they are lost.

Embrace a modified Hanlon's razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by absolute, complete, and utter indifference towards anything whatsoever having to do with you.

Finish the job! (Don't get sidetracked.)

Units, units, units!

Re: Job. Look at your own résumé, curriculum vitae (CV), and cover letter. Ask yourself and consider the question: Would you hire you for this position (e.g., over the other likely candidates)? If not, it might not be a good fit; perhaps best to move to the next opportunity.

Aim for good enough for government work. Achieve this and you can move on with life. After all, a decent government is one that exists to serve its people (one cannot say the same about the private sector).

May I please get an "F." for the homies? Esp. all the fallen soldiers. ("F." is Internet slang in solidarity for all is terrible in the world.)
