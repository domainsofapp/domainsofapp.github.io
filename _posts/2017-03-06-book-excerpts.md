## The Laws of Thermodynamics - Peter Atkins

Re Boltzmann's expression: At a given temperature - in the bulk sense - a collection of atoms consists of some in their lowest energy state (their "ground state"), some in the next higher energy state, and so on, with populations that diminish in progressively higher energy states. When the populations of the states have settled down into their "equilibrium" populations, although atoms continue to jump between energy levels, there is no net change in the populations [and] it turns out that these populations can be calculated from a knowledge of the energies of the states and a single parameter, beta.

## The Sunset Limited - Cormac McCarthy

White:

The one thing I wont give up is giving up. I expect that to carry me through. I'm depending on it. The things I believed in were very frail. As I said. They wont be around for long and neither will I. But I dont think that's really the reason for my decision. I think it goes deeper. You can acclimate yourself to loss. You have to. You give up the world line by line. Stoically. And then one day you realize that your courage is farcical. It doesnt mean anything. You've become an accomplice in your own annihilation and there is nothing you can do about it. Everything you do closes a door somewhere ahead of you. And finally there is only one door left.

The shadow of the axe hangs over every joy.

Black:

The light is all around you, cept you dont see nothin but shadow. And the shadow is you. You the one makin it.

You must love your brother or die.

If it aint what you lost that is more than you can bear then maybe it's what you wont lose. What you'd rather die than to give up.

I dont believe that the world can be better than what you allow it to be. Dark as a world as you live in, they aint goin to be a whole lot of surprises in the way of good news.
