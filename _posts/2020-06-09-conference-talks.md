## Conference Talks
<br>
Pointers:  
- Clear logic stream. Tell a story that flows, such that each paragraph or slide flows into the next.
- Avoid memory overload. Have a few key "takeaways".
- Sell your research to the audience. Make them go to the paper for the details.
- Use it as an opportunity to attract and meet people who are doing similar or related interesting work.
- PRACTICE, meaning several hours of reading your hand-written talk, re-reading it, and then getting comfortable paraphrasing it without having to read it.

## Creativity Begins at the Edge
"Change starts away from the spotlight. Then, it moves towards the center. That's why the most interesting ideas at a conference never come from the main stage. They come from the hallways and [at] the bar after sunset."
