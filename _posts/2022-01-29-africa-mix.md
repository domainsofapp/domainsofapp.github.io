<p class="meta">29 Jan 2022 - New York, NY</p>

NB: I can't find KALW's Africa Mix tracklists listed anywhere online. So, until I'm able to locate them, I'll begin posting my own, imperfect versions of them here (to the extent that I can). (To be clear, I don't want to do this!!! I'll stop as soon as I can find an alternative source of these tracklists somewhere on the Internet.) Even better: Please upload full recordings of the show a la Hearts of Space on PRX!

KALW's Africa Mix Tracklists

(NB: Tracklists are sometimes incorrectly referred to as playlists. A tracklist is the actually DJ-played subset of songs chosen from a longer playlist.)

<https://player.streamguys.com/kalw/sgplayer/player.php>

Compliments of Shazam & hours of laborious searching

And, of course, a million thank you's to the brilliant Emmanuel Nado & Edwin Okong'o, co-hosts of KALW's Africa Mix! As well as to all the artists (musicians) featured on the show (& to artists in general working to sustain rich culture and a life worth living for us all). Finally, please forgive me for any bugs, typos, or other errors herein (& throughout this blog) of which there are undoubtedly many.

(y) means highly recommended by me  
(ok) means purdy darn good
