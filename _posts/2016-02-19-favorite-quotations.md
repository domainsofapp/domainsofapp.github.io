From this it follows that the population of the whole universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination. --Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe

True love is modest, like that of a couple in a Marguerite Duras novel: while the two lovers hold hands, they do not look into each other's eyes; they look together outwards, to some third point, their common Cause. Perhaps there is no greater love than that of a revolutionary couple, where each of the two lovers is ready to abandon the other at any moment should the revolution demand it. They do not love each other less than the amorous couple bent on suspending all their terrestrial links and obligations in order to burn out in a night of unconditional passion - if anything, they love each other more. --Slavoj Žižek, Slovenian philosopher, Living in the End Times
