Or not so deep? That in itself is a deep thought...also quite random!

Why is trainspotting so popular in Europe? Is it as popular elsewhere?

How many times can you ride BART across the Bay without ear protection before you go deaf?

What would happen if someone started posting code on GitHub to bring down GitHub? (GitLab, etc.)

When we say internet we are often referring to google.com, i.e., whatever Google has indexed; "look it up on the internet" is really just to Google it; nice brand position for Google a la Kleenex's equation with tissues ("Hand me a Kleenex, please"), etc.

Notebooks to be transcribed??????
