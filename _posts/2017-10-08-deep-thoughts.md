Rhetoric is bad.

Why is trainspotting so popular in Europe? Is it as popular elsewhere?

How many times can you ride BART across the Bay before you go deaf? (Hopefully a lot.)

What is the probability of stepping in something without paying attention (in the Bay Area)?

What would happen if someone started posting code on GitHub to bring down GitHub (GitLab, etc.)?

When we say internet we are often referring to google.com, i.e., whatever Google has indexed; "look it up on the internet" is really just to Google it; nice brand position for Google a la Kleenex's equation with tissues ("Hand me a Kleenex, please"), etc.

Ketchup, the working wo/man's dressing

When a company is caught cheating (e.g., VW), perhaps the goverment should assume ownership and have oversight and channel future profits into the public sphere (i.e., they have lost the "privilege" to be private)

One way to fight AI job loss and increase societal happiness: Shorter work week

It is impossible to measure absolute zero. At some point the measurement device will add more energy to the system than what is there to measure.

Bankability represents use-value; price represents exchange-value.

Impressionism is realism with poor vision (heh heh).

Shall the birds of fortuity alight again?

Any smoke detector on the market should be proven to have an extremely low false positive AND false negative rate in terms of when it goes off. Also it should not go off as if there is a fire when the battery is low especially in the middle of the night.

## False Positive Paradox

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_paradox/>

"Suppose a disease has a prevalence of 1/1000. A test for the disease has a true positive rate of 100% — it never misses someone who has the disease. It also has a false positive rate of 5%. A patient takes the test and the result is positive. How likely is it that he has the disease? To find this out, we need to know what percent of people who tested positive have the disease. Suppose 1000 people are tested for the disease. Since the prevalence of the disease is 1/1000, we know that, on average, 1 person in that group of 1000 will have the disease. That person will test positive (100% true positive rate). We also know that 999 people, on average, don’t have the disease, and that 5% of them will test positive (false positives). That’s 999 x 0.05, or approximately 50 people. That means that 51 people will test positive (1 true positive and 50 false positives), and only one of those people will actually have the disease. Therefore, 1/51, or about 2% of the people who tested positive actually have the disease. So, the patient's chance of having the disease is about 2%."

So, for a prevalence of 1/1000 and false positive rate of 5% (which does not seem too bad), only 2% of people who are tested positive out of a population of 1000 will actually be positive!
