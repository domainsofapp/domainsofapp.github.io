Why is trainspotting so popular in Europe? Is it as popular elsewhere?

How many times can you ride BART across the Bay before you go deaf? (Hopefully a lot.)

What is the probability of stepping in something without paying attention (in the Bay Area)?

What would happen if someone started posting code on GitHub to bring down GitHub (GitLab, etc.)?

When we say internet we are often referring to google.com, i.e., whatever Google has indexed; "look it up on the internet" is really just to Google it; nice brand position for Google a la Kleenex's equation with tissues ("Hand me a Kleenex, please"), etc.

Ketchup, the working wo/man's dressing.

When a company is caught cheating (e.g., VW, PG&E), perhaps the government should assume ownership and have oversight and channel future profits into the public sphere (i.e., they have lost the "privilege" to be private)

One way to fight AI job loss and increase societal happiness: Shorter work week

It is impossible to measure absolute zero. At some point the measurement device will add more energy to the system than what is there to measure.

Bankability represents use-value; price represents exchange-value.

Impressionism is realism with poor vision (heh heh).

Shall the birds of fortuity alight again?

The traveling salesman problem is at the root of all navigation optimization algorithms.

Any smoke detector on the market should be proven to have an extremely low false positive AND false negative rate in terms of when it goes off. Also it should not go off as if there is a fire when the battery is low especially in the middle of the night.

Perhaps the difference between love and lust is analagous to that of the symbiotic and parasitic.

Writing legalese and raising a child are like programming (writing code) -- you must define the terminology before you can work with it.

The free market is like a Ouija board -- seemingly driven by a random assortment of the people's collective will but ultimately guided by those with the most power (and will to power).

Would you rather be stuck in a pool with a shark or in a cage with a tiger? I would choose shark and attempt to punch it in the nose.

## False Positive Paradox

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_paradox/>

"Suppose a disease has a prevalence of 1/1000. A test for the disease has a true positive rate of 100% — it never misses someone who has the disease. It also has a false positive rate of 5%. A patient takes the test and the result is positive. How likely is it that he has the disease? To find this out, we need to know what percent of people who tested positive have the disease. Suppose 1000 people are tested for the disease. Since the prevalence of the disease is 1/1000, we know that, on average, 1 person in that group of 1000 will have the disease. That person will test positive (100% true positive rate). We also know that 999 people, on average, don’t have the disease, and that 5% of them will test positive (false positives). That’s 999 x 0.05, or approximately 50 people. That means that 51 people will test positive (1 true positive and 50 false positives), and only one of those people will actually have the disease. Therefore, 1/51, or about 2% of the people who tested positive actually have the disease. So, the patient's chance of having the disease is about 2%."

So, for a prevalence of 1/1000 and false positive rate of 5% (which does not seem too bad), only 2% of people who are tested positive out of a population of 1000 will actually be positive!

Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis.

If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone.

If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and your friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming.

Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky feeling.

Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of the ones we already have.

Just because swans mate for life, I don't think its that big a deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going to find a swan that looks much better than the one you've got, so why not mate for life?

I can't stand cheap people. It makes me real mad when someone says something like, "Hey, when are you going to pay me that $100 you owe me?" or "Do you have that $50 you borrowed?" Man, quit being so cheap!

I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not for our children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex.

If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking, you can throw a real grenade at them.

Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.

Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a dungeon. But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you'd look out your little window and think, "Boy, I'm glad I'm not out in that."

Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil we are losing each year, but I told that story around the campfire and nobody got scared.

How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol? How about the pillow? It has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have that dangerous beak.

Instead of studying for finals, what about just going to the Bahamas and catching some rays? Maybe you'll flunk, but you might have flunked anyway; that's my point.

It's funny that pirates were always going around searching for treasure, and they never realized that the real treasure was the fond memories they were creating.

I like to go down to the dog pound and pretend that I've found my dog. Then I tell them to kill it anyway because I already gave away all of his stuff. Dog people sure don't have a sense of humor.

For centuries, people thought the moon was made of green cheese. Then the astronauts found that the moon is really a big hard rock. That's what happens to cheese when you leave it out.
