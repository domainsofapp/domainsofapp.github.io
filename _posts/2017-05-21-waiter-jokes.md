Curated from some book many years ago (not mine).

Waiter, what's this fly doing in my soup?  
Looks like the breast-stroke to me, sir.  

Waiter, this soup tastes funny?  
So why don't you laugh?  

Waiter, this coffee tastes like mud!  
I'm not surprised, sir, it was ground only a few minutes ago.  

Waiter, do you serve crabs?  
Sit down, sir - we serve anyone.  

Waiter, bring me tea without milk.  
We haven't any milk, sir. How about tea without cream?  

Waiter, I'll have a pork chop; no - make that a steak.  
I'm a waiter, sir; not a magician!  

Waiter, I asked for bread with my dinner.  
It's in the sausages, sir.  

Waiter, there is a fly in my salad.  
I'm sorry sir, I didn't know that you are vegetarian.  

Waiter, where is my honey?  
She left last week, sir.  

Waiter, there's a fly swimming in my soup.  
So what do you expect me to do, call a lifeguard?  

Waiter, what's the meaning of this fly in my tea-cup?  
I wouldn't know, sir. I'm a waiter, not a fortune-teller.  

Waiter, is this a lamb chop or a pork chop?  
Can't you tell by the taste?  
No, I can't  
Then what does it matter?  

Waiter, how long have you been here?  
Six months, sir.  
Ah, then, it can't be you who took my order.  

Waiter, does the pianist play requests?  
Yes, sir.  
Then ask him to play tiddlywinks until I've finished my meal.  

Waiter, my bill please.  
How did you find your luncheon, sir?  
With a magnifying glass.  

"Waiter, waiter! Bring me a crocodile sandwich, and make it snappy!".
