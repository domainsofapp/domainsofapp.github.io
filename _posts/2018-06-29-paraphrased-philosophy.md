## Anthropic Principle

The universe had to be such as to allow for observers to evolve within it. A universe without conscious observers would be logically inconsistent. No suprise that the universe is "improbably" tuned for life.

## Apriorism

Belief in categories of knowledge as simple givens; irreducible and immanent in the human by virtue of its inherent makeup (as opposed to, say, empiricism).

## Alain Badiou, French Philosopher

Truths that force knowledge lead to new truths; thus, old truths are ancestors of new truths; thus, old truths are eternalized when conceived (an Evental moment).

## Charles Baudelaire, French Poet

Regarded each new innovation, each new promise of an ideal existence within consumer society, as a failed enterprise. Regarded new commodities as already dead things. Our desires for new goods are ultimately self-defeating because soon enough our shiny new purchases will be forgotten junk stored in our attics and garages. All that is left after all those purchases are the debts and desire to feel at home while connecting to something larger than ourselves.

Dielectical turn: By embracing self-defeat, we actually get in closer touch with our shared fantasies and desires.

Cultural constructs are historically-contingent.

"Natural history" is human history.

Consider how words, acts, policies, etc. will be seen 50, 100, etc. years from now. Consider what is historically contingent. Consider how to frame words, acts, policies, etc. such that they may readily evolve more in sync with cultural evolution.

## George Boole, Mathematics Educator

1 + 1 = 1 (Boolean logic: True + True = True)

## Fred Brooks, American Software Engineer

The Mythical Man-Month: Adding a new person to a late project will make the project later.

## Charles Darwin, Naturalist

Evolve or go extinct.

## Decadence

Literary movement of late 19th century France and England characterized by refined aestheticism, artiface, and the quest for new sensations.

## Jacques Derrida, Algerian-French Philosopher

In order to say something, we must repeat what has already been said.

Use negation as a tool to get beyond our present boundaries of thought.

The more architectural something is, the more engineered something is, the more social something is.

The city is architecture's "Other" (capital "O"); that which supports and drives architecture but cannot be explained by it or understood.

Truth is to be found in the void. Emptiness is the space that defines the space of the real.

## Albert Einstein, Theoretical physicist

The laws of physics are the same at constant velocities.

Curved spacetime is matter and vice versa.

## Empiricism

All knowledge is derived from sense experience (as opposed to, say, apriorism).

## Epistemology

Investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge.

## Existentialism

Existence precedes essence.

## Michael Faraday, Scientist

Matter can only be recognized by forces acting on it.

## Nicholas Fearn, Philosopher

Analogy between quantum physics and computer game. Once you get to quantum level, everything becomes a probabilistic blur, just like in a computer game when you get to the edge a game (e.g., edge of forest or a room that is not really part of the game and the software developer blurs it out with random functions).

## Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Philosopher

We assume the world is unified, but we cannot grasp the unity ourselves.

Our knowledge is unique to its time and place and is consequently partial and relational.

There must be a collective "Mind" (capital "M") that grasps this sense of reality; referred to as the "Absolute" (capital "A").

Reality is an Idea (capital "I") in the Mind of the Absolute.

History is that Idea's coming into consciousness itself.

The Idea is always present, but it can realize itself concretely only in the collective consciousness of human beings and through time.

Knowledge is in part a property of the whole; an organic living member.

The Absolute is realized not in thought but in the unfolding of History (capital "H").

Self-realization is a necessarily social process.

The universal self is a power to realize itself in and through the materials of particular circumstances and opportunities into which an individual may be placed.

Empiricism is inadequate (empiricism, e.g., David Hume, defined below in Kant).

The body as an integrated organism.

Synthesizes: 1.) Subject and object, 2.) Matter and spirit, and 3.) Divine and human.

Reality is Mind; the universe is Spirit objectified.

Reality becomes itself retroactively through its symbolic registration (e.g., into language, social story-telling, the stories we call "history").

## Heraclitus, Greek Philosopher

The only thing constant is change.

## Immanuel Kant, Philosopher

How can we explain what we know except through the senses?

Wants to find a way to marry this question with empiricism (i.e., Newtonian science).

Empiricism: Knowledge derived from observation of sense-experience of discrete phenomena.

Newtonian Science: 1. Causality, 2. Spatiality, 3. Temporality

All experience is different discrete phenomena, yet we are a congruent people with similar interpretations of 1, 2, and 3.

Mind equipped with "categories" of knowledge outside our sensory conceptualizations.

Space and time are symbolic tools of the human consciousness for relating matter and symbolic meaning.

## Kurt Godel, Logician

This statement cannot be proved.

## Jacques Lacan, French Psychoanalyst

The world is a fantasy through which thought sustains itself.

## Friedrich Nietzsche, Philosopher

We manifest our will to power.

## M. Ng, Philosopher Friend

Paired with capitalism, new forms of representation (e.g., new identities) = new forms of materialism

## John Rawls, American Philosopher

How would you want the world to be if before you were born you did not know your place in it?

## Ferdinand de Saussure, Swiss Linguist

Language is a purely relational system. Words have no inner essence.

## Max Weber, Socialogist

The collapse of values proliferates in capitalism.

## Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosopher

The following sentence "breaks" the objective Truth (capital "T") of language: This sentence is false. Or, as kids would say: "It's opposite day."

Nothing changes. Anything that we say changes is all part of a "language game" (linguistic representation of reality).

Physics is not "True" (capital "T"), but it is useful.

Philosophy is "above" physics in this way. All there is for humans is the "language game" (which is not really a game as it has real implications). There is power to language and danger of getting lost in it and using it to manipulate others. Language, which is the same as knowledge, also encompassing physics, should only be used for good. It is the philosopher's job to establish and maintain definitions of good.

## Slavoj Zizek, Slovenian Philosopher

Climate change as existential crisis for humanity.

A choice is always a meta-choice, a choice of the modality of the choice itelf. (Modality: The mode in which something exists or is experienced or expressed.)

The semblance of what appears as reality is a veil, which veils nothing.
