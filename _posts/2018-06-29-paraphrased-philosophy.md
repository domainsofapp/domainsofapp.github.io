NB: Rumor has it that all Wikipedia links ultimately lead to "Philosophy".

## Anthropic Principle
The universe had to be such as to allow for observers to evolve within it. A universe without conscious observers would be logically inconsistent. No surprise that the universe is "improbably" tuned for life.

## Apriorism
Belief in categories of knowledge as simple givens; irreducible and immanent in the human by virtue of its inherent makeup (as opposed to, say, empiricism).

## Alain Badiou, French Philosopher
Truths that force knowledge lead to new truths; thus, old truths are ancestors of new truths; thus, old truths are eternalized when conceived (an Evental moment).

On Georg Cantor, Mathematician: There is the infinity of real numbers (real), there is the infinity of whole or natural numbers (imaginary), and there is a gap in between.

## Charles Baudelaire, French Poet
Regarded each new innovation, each new promise of an ideal existence within consumer society, as a failed enterprise. Regarded new commodities as already dead things. Our desires for new goods are ultimately self-defeating because soon enough our shiny new purchases will be forgotten junk stored in our attics and garages. All that is left after all those purchases are the debts and desire to feel at home while connecting to something larger than ourselves.

Dialectical turn: By embracing self-defeat, we actually get in closer touch with our shared fantasies and desires.

Cultural constructs are historically-contingent.

"Natural history" is human history.

Consider how words, acts, policies, etc. will be seen 50, 100, etc. years from now. Consider what is historically contingent. Consider how to frame words, acts, policies, etc. such that they may readily evolve more in sync with cultural evolution.

## Samuel Beckett, Irish Novelist
Waiting for Godot: Nothing, or the wait for something that is never going to happen.

## George Boole, Mathematics Educator
1 + 1 = 1 (Boolean logic: True + True = True)

## Fred Brooks, American Software Engineer
The Mythical Man-Month: Adding a new person to a late project will make the project later.

## Brené Brown, American Professor
Be vulnerable, or live with regrets.

## Albert Camus, French Philosopher
At bottom, everything's meaningless. Nonetheless, you can make meaning.

## Charles Darwin, Naturalist
Evolve or go extinct.

## Decadence
Literary movement of late 19th century France and England characterized by refined aestheticism, artifice, and the quest for new sensations. (Dictionary.com)

## Jacques Derrida, Algerian-French Philosopher
In order to say something, we must repeat what has already been said.

Use negation as a tool to get beyond our present boundaries of thought.

The more architectural something is, the more engineered something is, the more social something is.

The city is architecture's "Other" (capital "O"); that which supports and drives architecture but cannot be explained by it or understood.

Truth is to be found in the void. Emptiness is the space that defines the space of the real.

## Diogenes, Greek Philosopher
Cynicism requires perspective of life lost.

## Albert Einstein, Theoretical physicist
The laws of physics are the same at constant velocities.

Curved space-time is matter and vice versa.

## Empiricism
All knowledge is derived from sense experience (as opposed to, say, apriorism).

## Epictetus, Philosopher
First decide who you would be. Then do what you must do.

## Epistemology
Investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge.

## Existentialism
Existence precedes essence.

## Michael Faraday, Scientist
Matter can only be recognized by forces acting on it.

## Nicholas Fearn, Philosopher
Analogy between quantum physics and computer game. Once you get to quantum level, everything becomes a probabilistic blur, just like in a computer game when you get to the edge a game (e.g., edge of forest or a room that is not really part of the game and the software developer blurs it out with random functions).

## Richard Feynman, American Physicist
Don't obsess over the names or naming of things (i.e., pure memorization); rather, focus on understanding the thing itself and how it works to the best of your abilities.

## Game Theory
Tit for tat is the proven, most effective life strategy.

## Kurt Gödel, Logician
This statement cannot be proved.

## Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Philosopher
We assume the world is unified, but we cannot grasp the unity ourselves.

Our knowledge is unique to its time and place and is consequently partial and relational.

There must be a collective "Mind" (capital "M") that grasps this sense of reality; referred to as the "Absolute" (capital "A").

Reality is an Idea (capital "I") in the Mind of the Absolute.

History is that Idea's coming into consciousness itself.

The Idea is always present, but it can realize itself concretely only in the collective consciousness of human beings and through time.

Knowledge is in part a property of the whole; an organic living member.

The Absolute is realized not in thought but in the unfolding of History (capital "H").

Self-realization is a necessarily social process.

The universal self is a power to realize itself in and through the materials of particular circumstances and opportunities into which an individual may be placed.

Empiricism is inadequate (empiricism, e.g., David Hume, defined below in Kant).

The body as an integrated organism.

Synthesizes: 1.) Subject and object, 2.) Matter and spirit, and 3.) Divine and human.

Reality is Mind; the universe is Spirit objectified.

Reality becomes itself retroactively through its symbolic registration (e.g., into language, social story-telling, the stories we call "history").

The present is the inevitable result of all the historic events leading up to this point. There is no alternative, no other way except your life right now. The Spirit of History is within you; it constitutes human nature itself.

As humanity evolves, so does its reasoning and ability to reason. You cannot stop progress towards this end. This constitutes the Hegelian Spirit of History. Social "progress" (towards this end) is inevitable.

Master-slave dialectic: The boy is father to the man (or, the girl is mother to the woman); the "master" is slave to the slave.

## Heraclitus, Greek Philosopher
The only thing constant is change.

## Immanuel Kant, Philosopher
How can we explain what we know except through the senses?

Wants to find a way to marry this question with empiricism (i.e., Newtonian science).

Empiricism: Knowledge derived from observation of sense-experience of discrete phenomena.

Newtonian Science: 1. Causality, 2. Spatiality, 3. Temporality

All experience is different discrete phenomena, yet we are a congruent people with similar interpretations of 1, 2, and 3.

Mind equipped with "categories" of knowledge outside our sensory conceptualizations.

Space and time are symbolic tools of the human consciousness for relating matter and symbolic meaning.

## Jacques Lacan, French Psychoanalyst
The world is a fantasy through which thought sustains itself.

## Ernst Mach, Austrian Physicist
Mach asks, "What constitutes a melody?" It seems incorrect to say that the actual sound vibrations constitute the melody as we have just seen that numerous different sounds can make the same melody. But on the other hand, it seems empirically odd to say that a melody is not constituted out of its sounds. The actual melody, then, exists in our ability to recognize it. It is formed by experience of one or more examples of the melody, but it is an idealization of that experience. Significantly, the idealization captures not the actual sounds, but the relationships of the sounds to one another. Thus a melody can be sung in a high or low pitch, etc., but as long as the relationships remain the same we recognize it as the same melody. For Mach, this process is at the basis of all perception. Experience requires an "a priori", but that a priori is itself formed by experience. This process is also at the root of evolutionary processes.

## Niccolò Machiavelli, Italian Diplomat
You have to be cruel to be kind. --David Ignatius, Journalist (in BBC's The Forum Ep. on Machiavelli - Master of Power, and based on Cruel to be Kind by Nick Lowe, British Singer-songwriter)

## Cormac McCarthy
“I don't believe in God. Can you understand that? Look around you man. Can't you see? The clamor and din of those in torment has to be the sound most pleasing to his ear. And I loathe these discussions. The argument of the village atheist whose single passion is to revile endlessly that which he denies the existence of in the first place. Your fellowship is a fellowship of pain and nothing more. And if that pain were actually collective instead of simply reiterative then the sheer weight of it would drag the world from the walls of the universe and send it crashing and burning through whatever night it might yet be capable of engendering until it was not even ash. And justice? Brotherhood? Eternal life? Good god, man. Show me a religion that prepares one for death. For nothingness. There's a church I might enter. Yours prepares one only for more life. For dreams and illusions and lies. If you could banish the fear of death from men's hearts they wouldn't live a day. Who would want this nightmare if not for fear of the next? The shadow of the axe hangs over every joy. Every road ends in death. Or worse. Every friendship. Every love. Torment, betrayal, loss, suffering, pain, age, indignity, and hideous lingering illness. All with a single conclusion. For you and for everyone and everything that you have chosen to care for. There's the true brotherhood. The true fellowship. And everyone is a member for life. You tell me that my brother is my salvation? My salvation? Well then damn him. Damn him in every shape and form and guise. Do I see myself in him? Yes, I do. And what I see sickens me. Do you understand me? Can you understand me?” --Cormac McCarthy, The Sunset Limited

## Herman Melville, American Novelist
Bartleby, the Scrivener: I would prefer not to.

## Friedrich Nietzsche, Philosopher
We manifest our will to power.

In order to survive, at every moment we must exert our will to power and impose our unique selves unto the world.

## M. Ng, Philosopher Friend
Paired with capitalism, new forms of representation (e.g., new identities) = new forms of materialism.

## Parallax View
Looking at something from radically different perspectives; the only way to break through a dialectical stalemate and make real progress as a society.

## Willard Van Orman Quine, American Philosopher
Words only have meaning insofar as we humans place meaning in them.

## John Rawls, American Philosopher
How would you want the world to be if before you were born you did not know your place in it?

## John Ray, Naturalist
Don't give someone the rope to hang you with.

Allow someone to continue on a course and then suffer its consequences. For example, "The auditor knew something was wrong but decided to give the chief accountant enough rope." This expression, a shortening of enough rope to hang oneself, was already proverbial in John Ray's English Proverbs (1678).

## Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Philosopher
From "The Social Contract": People will begin to conform in their opinions and conglomerate into small “cliques” or larger parties. Eventually, it will essentially become two people with opposing opinions voting against each another.

## Ferdinand de Saussure, Swiss Linguist
Language is a purely relational system. Words have no inner essence.

## Erwin Schrödinger, Austrian-Irish Physicist
The growth of the bacterium could be analyzed as a reduction in the entropy of its part of the universe. --From Erwin Schrödinger book: What is Life? (1943)

## Max Weber, Sociologist
The collapse of values proliferates in capitalism.

## John Archibald Wheeler, American Physicist
"It from bit."

"What we call the past is built on bits."

Every it--every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself--derives its function, its meaning, its very existence...from bits. Why does nature appear quantized? Because information is quantized. The bit is the ultimate unsplittable particle.

"Probability, like time, is a concept invented by humans, and humans have to bear the responsibility for the obscurities that attend it."

## Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosopher
The following sentence "breaks" the objective Truth (capital "T") of language: This sentence is false. Or, as kids would say: "It's opposite day."

Nothing changes. Anything that we say changes is all part of a "language game" (linguistic representation of reality).

Physics is not "True" (capital "T"), but it is useful.

Philosophy is "above" physics in this way. All there is for humans is the "language game" (which is not really a game as it has real implications). There is power to language and danger of getting lost in it and using it to manipulate others. Language, which is the same as knowledge, also encompassing physics, should only be used for good. It is the philosopher's job to establish and maintain definitions of good.

## Stephen Wolfram, American-British Computer Scientist
PhD thesis related to cellular-genetic approach of embedding within something the ingredients and algorithm to make itself, as with genetic code that encodes and writes the makings of a biological organism.

Physics is inherently a computation in the form of cellular automata.

## Slavoj Žižek, Slovenian Philosopher
Climate change is an existential crisis for humanity.

A choice is always a meta-choice--a choice of the modality of the choice itself. (Modality: The mode in which something exists or is experienced or expressed.)

The semblance of what appears as reality is a veil which veils nothing.

Essence is real only as appearance.

Essence has no existence independent of its manifestation in appearance.

There is a truth, and not everything is relative, but this truth is the truth of the perspectival distortion as such, not a truth distorted by the partial view from a one-sided perspective.

Ideology is like a coordinate transform of our experienced reality.

## Uncanny Valley
Cover band: It is more weird when a cover band sounds just like the real band but strays off-key from time to time vs. a cover band that does their own unique variation of the original sound (and thereby always sounds "off-key", so to speak, in reference to the original).

Animals doing it: Hearing or seeing animals (e.g., cats or dogs) go at it is incredibly awkward not because you are "violating their privacy" but because it looks like what humans sometimes do, too, and, in turn, reminds us that we are animals, which is a fact that we do not like to accept for some (likely pretentious and highfalutin) reason(s).

Electronic DJ: Everything is great--dancing, partying, all sorts of fun--until the computer suddenly freezes and everyone realizes that everyone is going crazy over a computer playing a track (likely made by a computer).
