NB: I am not a professional philosopher and offer no guarantees of the accuracy of these characterizations or whether I correctly attributed ideas to people in the process of transcribing notes. Nonetheless, I hope ideas herein may be fodder for philosophical thought, debate, and discussion.

## Charles Baudelaire, French Poet

Regarded each new innovation, each new promise of an ideal existence within consumer society, as a failed enterprise. Regarded new commodities as already dead things. Our desires for new goods are ultimately self-defeating because soon enough our shiny new purchases will be forgotten junk stored in our attics and garages. All that is left after all those purchases are the debts and desire to feel at home while connecting to something larger than ourselves.

Dielectical turn: By embracing self-defeat, we actually get in closer touch with our shared fantasies and desires.

Cultural constructs are historically-contingent.

"Natural history" is human history.

Consider how words, acts, policies, etc. will be seen 50, 100, etc. years from now. Consider what is historically contingent. Consider how to frame words, acts, policies, etc. such that they may readily evolve more in sync with cultural evolution.

## George Boole, Mathematics Educator

1 + 1 = 1 (Boolean logic: True + True = True)

## Jacques Derrida, Algerian-French Philosopher

In order to say something, we must repeat what has already been said.

Use negation as a tool to get beyond our present boundaries of thought.

The more architectural something is, the more engineered something is, the more social something is.

The city is architecture's "Other" (capital "O"); that which supports and drives architecture but cannot be explained by it or understood.

Truth is to be found in the void. Emptiness is the space that defines the space of the real.

## Albert Einstein, Theoretical physicist

The laws of physics are the same at constant velocities.

## Kurt Godel, Logician

This statement cannot be proved.

## John Rawls, American Philosopher

How would you want the world to be if before you were born you didn't know your place in it?

## Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosopher

Nothing changes. Anything that we say changes is all part of a "language game" (linguistic representation of reality).

Physics is not "True" (capital "T"), but it is useful.

Philosophy is "above" physics in this way. All there is for humans is the "language game" (which is not really a game as it has real implications). There is power to language and danger of getting lost in it and using it to manipulate others. Language, which is the same as knowledge, also encompassing physics, should only be used for good. It is the philosopher's job to establish and maintain definitions of good.

## Slavoj Zizek, Slovenian Philosopher  

Climate change as existential crisis for humanity.
