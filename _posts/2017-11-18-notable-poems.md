## Hamlet Act 3 Scene 1 Page 4

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,  
Th' oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,  
The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,  
The insolence of office, and the spurns  
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,  
When he himself might his quietus make  
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,  
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  
But that the dread of something after death,  
The undiscovered country from whose bourn  
No traveler returns, puzzles the will  
And makes us rather bear those ills we have  
Than fly to others that we know not of?  
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
And thus the native hue of resolution  
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,  
And enterprises of great pith and moment  
With this regard their currents turn awry,  
And lose the name of action.—Soft you now,  
The fair Ophelia!—Nymph, in thy orisons  
Be all my sins remembered.  

by Shakespeare

## Epistemology

I.  
Kick at the rock, Sam Johnson, break your bones:  
But cloudy, cloudy is the stuff of stones.  

II.  
We milk the cow of the world, and as we do  
We whisper in her ear, "You are not true."  

by Richard Wilbur

## Everywhere You Go, There You Are

Nothing speaks volumes  
imprisoned dreams jailed forever  
forgiveness weeps  
no tears are released  
silence begs for ease  
anger has no hope  
indifference rejoices  
while nothing holds court with jesters of time  
Nothing waits, and waits.

by Heidi Sweets

## Owl

The music it  
pulsates in my ears like  
a beating heart induces  
a beating life;  
starts screeching like an  
owl on the hunt who  
scares and who  
looks and who  
sees and who  
never panics because  
every action is familiar and  
every action is  
for survival.

## A Poem About Anxiety

Ms Green didn’t believe her mind  
was a dark room full of poisons—  
a room cluttered with rags  
pills, torn tinsel, perfume  
in lavender glass. She got stuck sometimes  
inside her mind like a bit of lint  
caught in a web meant for a fly.  
She got stuck sometimes  
sitting still, almost polite  
with every limb consumed by fire—  
she told herself her mind  
was a buried animal a burning light.  
But today Ms Green learned to reach inside  
and touch her own mind, lightly—  
her mind more like  
a stalled record player playing  
one song in deep-grooved vinyl—  
today she learned to pick up the needle  
and move it a little to the right—.

## Relax

--for anxious A.

Bad things are going to happen.  
Your tomatoes will grow a fungus  
and your cat will get run over.  
Someone will leave the bag with the ice cream  
melting in the car and throw  
your blue cashmere sweater in the dryer.  
Your husband will sleep  
with a girl your daughter’s age, her breasts spilling  
out of her blouse. Or your wife  
will remember she’s a lesbian  
and leave you for the woman next door. The other cat—  
the one you never really liked—will contract a disease  
that requires you to pry open its feverish mouth  
every four hours. Your parents will die.  
No matter how many vitamins you take,  
how much Pilates, you’ll lose your keys,  
your hair, and your memory. If your daughter  
doesn’t plug her heart  
into every live socket she passes,  
you’ll come home to find your son has emptied  
the refrigerator, dragged it to the curb,  
and called the used-appliance store for a pickup—drug money.  
The Buddha tells a story of a woman chased by a tiger.  
When she comes to a cliff, she sees a sturdy vine  
and climbs halfway down. But there’s also a tiger below.  
And two mice—one white, one black—scurry out  
and begin to gnaw at the vine. At this point  
she notices a wild strawberry growing from a crevice.  
She looks up, down, at the mice.  
Then she eats the strawberry.  
So here’s the view, the breeze, the pulse  
in your throat. Your wallet will be stolen, you’ll get fat,  
slip on the bathroom tiles in a foreign hotel  
and crack your hip. You’ll be lonely.  
Oh, taste how sweet and tart  
the red juice is, how the tiny seeds  
crunch between your teeth.

## The Interrogation of the Good -- by Bertolt Brecht

Step forward: we hear  
that you are a good man.  
You cannot be bought, but the lightning  
which strikes the house, also  
cannot be bought.  
You hold to what you said.  
But what did you say?  
You are honest, you say your opinion.  
Which opinion?  
You are brave.  
Against whom?  
You are wise.  
For whom?  
You do not consider your personal advantages.  
Whose advantages do you consider then?  
You are a good friend.  
Are you also a good friend of the good people?  
Hear us then: we know.  
You are our enemy. This is why we shall  
now put you in front of a wall. But in consideration  
of your merits and good qualities  
We shall put you in front of a good wall and shoot you  
with a good bullet from a good gun and bury you  
with a good shovel in the good earth.

## I Walk Into Every Room and Yell Where the Mexicans At?

i know we exist because of what we make. my dad works at a steel mill. he worked at a steel mill my whole life. at the party, the liberal white woman tells me she voted for hillary & wishes bernie won the nomination. i stare in the mirror if i get too lonely. thirsty to see myself i once walked into the lake until i almost drowned. the white woman at the party who might be liberal but might have voted for trump smiles when she tells me how lucky i am. how many automotive components do you think my dad has made. you might drive a car that goes and stops because of something my dad makes. when i watch the news i hear my name, but never see my face. every other commercial is for taco bell. all my people fold into a $2 crunchwrap supreme. the white woman means lucky to be here and not mexico. my dad sings por tu maldito amor & i’m sure he sings to america. y yo caí en tu trampa ilusionado. the white woman at the party who may or may not have voted for trump tells me she doesn’t meet too many mexicans in this part of new york city. my mouth makes an oh, but i don’t make a sound. a waiter pushes his brown self through the kitchen door carrying hors d’oeuvres. a song escapes through the swinging door. selena sings pero ay como me duele & the good white woman waits for me to thank her.
