App to integrate Lyft, Uber, etc. w/ Google Transit ideally all w/in Google Maps (i.e., tells you where to optimally get off public transit and get in Lyft/Uber).

Free version of Lyft/Uber; replace hitchhiking w/ heavily vetted rider and driver model; take advantage of people who are already going in a certain direction and have space in the vehicle.

Massively overbuild solar and "burn off" the excess (option to use trackers to curtail energy according to modified cosine curve).

App solution for facilitating conversations with nearby strangers (Silicon Valley idea, heh).  
e.g., those participating want to chat and meet strangers  
e.g., within certain physical range  
e.g., anonymous invitation must be accepted  
e.g., only positive statements available; idea is to lead to in-person conversation in the least number of steps  
e.g., not sure providing visual identifier is necessary; discriminates against the blind anyway  
Motivation is to bring people together in-person in a social way who might not otherwise engage

Keychain dongle that beeps when it finds public WiFi.

Free version of Lyft/Uber to replace hitchhiking (with validated riders and drivers).

Develop national and international testing and analysis standards on Git where changes are managed via Pull Requests.

Something you attach to ceiling to cancel out noise vibrations.

Nerf gun LEDs - shoot around room, stick to walls, immediately illuminate the room in different/changing colors.

Apply traveling salesman problems in operations and maintenance (O&M) optimization algorithms.

Dropbox, Box, etc. should have a good solution for managing all document access privileges in one place (e.g., spreadsheet) instead of having to go into each individual/specific folder to check who has access.

Create system for journalists that tallies citations aka references (similar to the systems that track citations of scientific publications).

A rubber glove putter-oner device you stick your hand into to easily don rubber gloves.

3-D printer for smells. The printer would have a number of cartridges containing the chemicals of different smells.
