App to integrate Lyft, Uber, etc. with Google Transit ideally all within Google Maps (i.e., tells you where to optimally get off public transit and get in Lyft or Uber).

Free version of Lyft or Uber; replace hitchhiking with heavily vetted rider and driver model; take advantage of people who are already going in a certain direction and have space in the vehicle and are properly vetted as non-violent or -threatening).

Massively overbuild solar and "burn off" the excess (option to use trackers to curtail energy according to modified cosine curve).

App solution for facilitating conversations with nearby strangers (Silicon Valley idea, heh).  
e.g., those participating want to chat and meet strangers  
e.g., within certain physical range  
e.g., anonymous invitation must be accepted  
e.g., only positive statements available; idea is to lead to in-person conversation in the least number of steps  
e.g., not sure providing visual identifier is necessary; discriminates against the blind anyway  
Motivation is to bring people together in-person in a social way who might not otherwise engage

Keychain dongle that beeps when it finds public WiFi.

Free version of Lyft or Uber to replace hitchhiking (with validated riders and drivers).

Develop national and international testing and analysis standards on Git where changes are managed via Pull Requests.

Something you attach to ceiling to cancel out noise vibrations.

Nerf gun with glow stick or LED nerf darts: Shoot them around the room so they stick to walls. They will immediately illuminate any room in different and changing (time-dynamic) colors.

Apply traveling salesman problems in operations and maintenance (O&M) optimization algorithms.

Add good solution to Dropbox, Box, etc. for managing all document access privileges in one place (e.g., spreadsheet) instead of having to go into each individual, specific folder to check who has access.

System for journalists that tallies citations aka references (similar to the systems that track citations of scientific publications).

A rubber glove putter onner device you stick your hand into to easily don rubber gloves. --Credit to T.R.S.

3D printer for smells. The printer would have a number of cartridges containing the chemicals of different smells.

Social Bubble app for managing social connections in the physical world during a global pandemic. --Credit to J.H.F.

In theory, going from one computer or computing session to another could be as simple as entering one set of credentials and one or more multi-factor authentication password(s) or PIN(s); so seamless that a complete login implies that the difference in the checksum of all your personal (non-application) data (including all metadata about which applications were in use and all their current, comprehensive settings) from the time of logout resulted in zero.

Simple message to post-Steve Jobs Apple: The problem with removing the headphone jack from the iPhone is that now you cannot listen to something with your preferred, traditional, better sounding, more reliable, wired headphones or via speaker system via stereo adapter cable (or talk via microphone) and charge your phone with your preferred, traditional, more reliable, wired charger-adapter-cable assembly at the same time. Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave--he was a warrior-promoter of media (including audio), creativity, culture, an excellent user experience, not royally p!$$!ng off the Apple customer base, &c. and you ruined his product with this one major hardware-software change decision. Please restore the headphone jack to all iPhones! (Incidentally, there are additional benefits to keeping the phone plugged in beyond charging, e.g., iPhone updates and backups only occur while the phone is connected to a source of electrical power.)

While we are on Apple, the cable of the iPhone charger leads to the following practice: Say your iPhone is charging on a desk. It is connected to the charging cable which is connected to the charging adapter which is in turn connected to a power supply (e.g., with a built-in surge protector) which in this example is on the ground. The user picks up the phone from the desk, unplugs it, and drops the iPhone charging cable on the floor because there is nothing else to do with the cable. Biologically, the floor is a mess of bacteria and viruses. Would you eat off the floor? Would you eat with your hands after touching the cable which was just lying on the floor? The charging cable is too short to stay on the desk (unless you take great care to put and maintain some external weight on it so it does not fall, or employ some other mode of fixation) and there is no built-in weight on the end of it that keeps it on the desk. Without much contemplation, I suggest considering the latter design; naively, it sounds cool to me.

GitHub: Aggregate and display each user's percentage (%) and amount (e.g., number of lines) of code written in each language, pulling from both private and public repositories. That way, e.g., future employers can have more insight into what a programmer has done without viewing the proprietary code.

Windows: When you delete a folder or file, Windows should specifically warn you if the byte size is not zero upon deletion.

Gmail: When you delete a draft, why not move it to the trash?
