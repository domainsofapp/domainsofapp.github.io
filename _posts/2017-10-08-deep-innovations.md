App to integrate Uber, Lyft, etc. with Google Transit

Massively overbuild solar and "burn off" the excess (option to use trackers to curtail energy according to modified cosine curve)

App solution for facilitating conversations with nearby strangers (Silicon Valley idea, heh)  
e.g., those participating want to chat and meet strangers  
e.g., within certain physical range  
e.g., anonymous invitation must be accepted  
e.g., only positive statements available; idea is to lead to in-person conversation in the least number of steps  
e.g., not sure providing visual identifier is necessary; discriminates against the blind anyway  
Motivation is to bring people together in-person in a social way who might not otherwise engage
