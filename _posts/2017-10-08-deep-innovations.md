App to integrate Lyft, Uber, etc. w/ Google Transit ideally all w/in Google Maps (i.e., tells you where to optimally get off public transit and get in Lyft/Uber).

Free version of Lyft/Uber; replace hitchhiking w/ heavily vetted rider and driver model; take advantage of people who are already going in a certain direction and have space in the vehicle and are properly vetted as non-violent/-threatening).

Massively overbuild solar and "burn off" the excess (option to use trackers to curtail energy according to modified cosine curve).

App solution for facilitating conversations with nearby strangers (Silicon Valley idea, heh).  
e.g., those participating want to chat and meet strangers  
e.g., within certain physical range  
e.g., anonymous invitation must be accepted  
e.g., only positive statements available; idea is to lead to in-person conversation in the least number of steps  
e.g., not sure providing visual identifier is necessary; discriminates against the blind anyway  
Motivation is to bring people together in-person in a social way who might not otherwise engage

Keychain dongle that beeps when it finds public WiFi.

Free version of Lyft/Uber to replace hitchhiking (with validated riders and drivers).

Something you attach to ceiling to cancel out noise vibrations.

Nerf gun w/ glow stick/LED nerf darts: Shoot them around the room so they stick to walls. They'll immediately illuminate any room in different and changing (time-dynamic) colors.

Apply traveling salesman problems in operations and maintenance (O&M) optimization algorithms.

Dropbox, Box, etc. should have a good solution for managing all document access privileges in one place (e.g., spreadsheet) instead of having to go into each individual/specific folder to check who has access.

System for journalists that tallies citations aka references (similar to the systems that track citations of scientific publications).

Social Bubble app for managing social connections in the physical world during a global pandemic. --Credit to J.H.F.

In theory, going from one computer/computing session to another could be as simple as entering one set of credentials and one or more multi-factor authentication password(s)/PIN(s); so seamless that a complete login implies that the difference in the checksum of all your personal (non-application) data (including all metadata about which applications were in use and all their current, comprehensive settings) from the time of logout resulted in zero.
