Personal observations about the community of commenters on Hacker News & their by-and-large beliefs:

- Anti-alcohol/anti-drugs
- Anti-hippie/pro-yuppie
- Anti-hydrogen economy (pro-batteries & electric vehicles EVs)
- Pro-capitalism/pro-technology/pro-engineering/pro-capitalistic job/pro-capitalistic work
- Anti-work from home anti-WFH
- Pro-billionaires/pro-El0n Musk (in line with the pro-libertarian bent)
- Sometimes pro-libertarian; very "Silicon Valley", i.e., pro-Si Valley tech mind (Y Combinator case in point)/pro- tech will save/preserve the world as we know it, not destroy/end it (as it already, arguably/provably, has)
- Pro-life/pro-kids (or else your life is a complete, utter, waste/shameful failure) - after all, your unbridled-capitalist G0d "PG" told you so...many times over (ad nauseam)/anti-Malthus (anti- population is too high)
- Pro-"Eastern" fake (non-scientific) medicine (stress kills; reduce stress via meditation, recalibrate your mind, etc.); have real physical pain? Just change your mindset, maaan! It worked for me - I guarantee it! Tell 10 people & you'll have even less physical pain! HACKer News, indeed, SMH...
- Religious (Christian)/pro-G0d/pro-Jesus; The Bible (New Testament) iseth the bestest booketh of all timeth undereth the suneth (unfortunately, no one addresses the absurd, intrinsic belief that non-believers in (wo)man-made Jesus go to (wo)man-made H3ll or the fact that G0d is not real in any objective sense; It's (wo)man-made & thus subject to subject aka user interpretation & perpetual manipulation & influence driven by (wo)man-made power dynamics exposed by the likes of Michel Foucault not to mention overall a financial scam (pyramid scheme) and highly effective way to politically suppress The People aka The People's discontent re the status quo's state of profound inequity & inequality, a la Karl Marx's opiate of the masses, or else influence them with their own political agenda ultimately for increased financial & thus power gains...oh, but I digress...)
- Pro-nuclear (pro-baseload)/anti-renewables (anti-intermittent power sources)
- Anti-cryptocurrency/anti-blockchain
- Pro-social media (& anti-censorship), but anti- spending time on social media (despite spending time & participating on the Hacker News social media website)
- Anti-government/anti-federal government regulation (wishes to dismantle the federal regulatory apparatus)
- Pro-working on (engineering, software development, etc.) projects which have nothing to do with protecting everyday people or the planet (Earth - not Mars) in any meaningful or essential way (no existentially significant meaning)
- Mars- and general space travel-obsessed (again, part of the Musk/Bezos/other-mega-billionaire-with-too-much-time-any-money-on-their-hands-and-who-doesn't-care-about-people-suffering-on-Planet-Earth delusions)
- Self-driving car-obsessed (see point above re delusions)/public transit-agnostic (seemingly could care less)
- Pro-batteries (-battery)/pro-electric vehicles EVs/anti-hydrogen economy (again, see points above re Musk delusions), seemingly ignorant of the corresponding multitudes (multiple forms of) slavery and catastrophic (disastrous), long-lasting impacts of precious + rare-earth metal mining
- Obsessed with microplastics (even beyond ubiquitous, prevalent, poisonous, toxic lead or other heavy metal poisoning/toxicity, e.g., which come with their beloved technologies, e.g., computer-related electronics and batteries)
- Typical Hacker News comment thread narrative/sequence for a pro-nuclear power article: 1.) Top comment is pro-nuclear energy, 2.) Top response to #1 is anti-nuclear/pro-renewable energy (pro-solar/-wind), 3.) Top response to #2 is the intermittent power vs. base load/storage complaint. Finally, what everyone misses is the solar PV/wind/green hydrogen economy (hint: no batteries).
- Pro- fancy, software "engineering"/anti- basic, necessary IT jobs. People with IT degrees failing at/refusing to do, due to sanctimoniousness, basic IT jobs which help everyday people. Non-computer-oriented (non-tech savvy) employees cannot get proper tech (IT) support. Everyday people cannot get personalized, individual technical support (without, say, going through an AI app or a ticket response system with automated, templatized, and altogether useless (non-)responses).

Overall, highly socially conservative, libertarian, and often ideological & hypocritical, with both sides of the arguments being factually incorrect. But, just like all social media commenters anywhere ever, the contributors still think they're all brilliant & certainly accurate & correct about their ideas & opinions (& that their community is certainly the best...i.e., self-congratulatory). Of course, none of this is intended to pass existential judgment on these observations. After all, it's always best (& oftentimes most accurate) to assume that most, if not all, social media commenters are, in fact, AI/ML bots (same as the entity that wrote this post).

Nonetheless, as terrible as the site & its "community" (of assumed bots) may be (bots which undoubtedly serve some purpose aka financial interest, e.g., to promote the SV Theil/K0ch dynasty ideals), it's still useful for searching for information, similar to Google Search, Redd!t, & the far superior (& far more civil & human) Lobste.rs, provided you're capable of interpreting that information using critical thinking & sound information literacy (skills which do not come easy & take multiple dozens of years to cultivate). So, as with most things in life, not True in any real sense, but still useful...

Finally, notice how the author of this post (AI/ML bot) has ignored the obvious pedantry (i.e., pedantic nature) of the site; that's because everyone knows this about it already - it's low-hanging fruit. In fact, it's not a bug - it's *the* key (core) feature of it - e.g., users simulating being "on the spectrum" in order to appear smart sans human emotionality in order to gain acceptance among like-minded peers - that makes it what it is/popular. Anyway, altogether, congr@s to the founders, maintainers, & moderator(s) of the site for achieving, well, something special!
