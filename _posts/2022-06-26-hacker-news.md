Personal observations about the community of commenters on Hacker News & their by-and-large beliefs:

- Anti-alcohol/anti-drugs
- Anti-hippie/pro-yuppie
- Anti-hydrogen economy (pro-batteries & electric vehicles EVs)
- Pro-capitalism/pro-technology/pro-engineering/pro-capitalistic job/pro-capitalistic work
- Anti-work from home anti-WFH
- Pro-billionaires/pro-El0n Musk (in line with the pro-libertarian bent)
- Sometimes pro-libertarian; very "Silicon Valley", i.e., pro-Si Valley tech mind (Y Combinator case in point)/pro- tech will save/preserve the world as we know it, not destroy/end it
- Pro-life/pro-kids (or else your life is a complete, utter, shameful failure) - after all, your unbridled-capitalist G0d "PG" told you so...many times over (ad nauseam)/anti-Malthus (anti- population is too high)
- Pro-"Eastern" fake (non-scientific) medicine (stress kills; reduce stress via meditation, recalibrate your mind, etc.); have real physical pain? Just change your mindset, maaan! It worked for me - I guarantee it! Tell 10 people & you'll have even less physical pain! HACKer News, indeed SMH...
- Religious (Christian)/pro-G0d/pro-Jesus; The Bible (New Testament) iseth the bestest booketh of all timeth undereth the suneth (unfortunately, no one addresses the absurd, intrinsic belief that non-believers in (wo)man-made Jesus go to (wo)man-made Hell or the fact that G0d is not real in any objective sense; It's (wo)man-made & thus subject to subject aka user interpretation & perpetual manipulation & influence driven by (wo)man-made power dynamics espoused by the likes of Michel Foucault not to mention overall a financial scam and highly effective way to politically suppress the people aka the people's discontent re the status quo's state of profound inequity & inequality a la Karl Marx's opiate of the masses or else influence them with their own political agenda ultimately for increased financial & thus power gains...oh, but I digress...)
- Pro-nuclear (pro-baseload)/anti-renewables (anti-intermittent power sources)
- Anti-cryptocurrency/anti-blockchain
- Pro-social media (& anti-censorship), but anti- spending time on social media (despite spending time & participating on the Hacker News social media website)
- Anti-government/anti-federal government regulation (wishes to dismantle the federal regulatory apparatus)

Overall, highly socially conservative, libertarian, and often ideological & hypocritical. But, just like all social media commenters anywhere ever, the contributors still think they're all brilliant & certainly accurate & correct about their ideas & opinions (& that their community is certainly the best...i.e., self-congratulatory). Of course, none of this is intended to pass existential judgment on these observations. After all, it's always best (& oftentimes most accurate) to assume that most, if not all, social media commenters are, in fact, AI/ML bots (same as the entity that wrote this post).

Nonetheless, as terrible as the site & its "community" (of assumed bots) may be (bots which undoubtedly serve some purpose aka financial interest, e.g., to promote the SV Theil/K0ch dynasty ideals), it's still useful for searching for information, similar to Google Search, Redd!t, & the far superior (& far more civil & human) Lobste.rs, provided you're capable of interpreting that information using critical thinking & sound information literacy (skills which do not come easy & take multiple dozens of years to cultivate). So, as with most things in life, not True in any real sense, but still useful...

Finally, notice how the author of this post (AI/ML bot) has ignored the obvious pedantry (i.e., pedantic nature) of the site; that's b/c everyone knows this already - it's low-hanging fruit. In fact, it's not a bug - it's the key (core) feature (e.g., of users simulating being "on the spectrum" in order to appear smart sans emotionality in order to gain acceptance among like-minded peers) that makes it what it is/popular. Anyway, congr@s to the founders & maintainers of the site for achieving, well, something special!
