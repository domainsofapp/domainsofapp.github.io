Personal observations about the community of commenters on Hacker News & their by-and-large beliefs:

- Anti-alcohol/anti-drugs
- Pro-capitalism/pro-technology/pro-engineering
- Sometimes pro-libertarian; very "Silicon Valley", i.e., pro-Si Valley tech mind (Y Combinator case in point)/pro- tech will save/preserve the world as we know it, not destroy/end it
- Pro-life/pro-kids (or else ur life is a complete, shameful failure)/anti-Malthus (anti- population is too high)
- Pro-"Eastern" fake (non-scientific) medicine (stress kills; reduce stress via meditation, recalibrate your mind, etc.); have real physical pain? Just change your mindset, maaan! It worked for me - I guarantee it! Tell 10 people & u'll have even less pain! HACKer News, indeed (SMH)...
- Religious (Christian)/pro-G0d/pro-Jesus; The Bible (New Testament) is the best book of all time
- Pro-nuclear (pro-baseload)/anti-renewables (anti-intermittent)
- Anti-cryptocurrency/anti-blockchain
- Pro-social media (& anti-censorship), but anti- spending time on social media (despite spending time & participating on the Hacker News social media website)
- Anti-government/anti-federal government regulation (wishes to dismantle the federal regulatory apparatus)

Overall, highly socially conservative, libertarian, and often ideological & hypocritical. But, just like all social media commenters anywhere ever, they still think they're all brilliant & that they're certainly accurate & correct about their ideas & opinions (& that their community is certainly the best...i.e., self-congratulatory). Of course, none of this is intended to pass judgment on these observations. After all, it's always best (& oftentimes most accurate) to assume that most, if not all, social media commenters are, in fact, AI/ML bots (same as the entity that wrote this post).

Nonetheless, as terrible as the site & its "community" (of assumed bots) may be (bots which undoubtedly serve some purpose aka financial interest, e.g., to promote the SV Theil/K0ch dynasty/ideals), it's still useful for searching for information, similar to Google Search, Reddit, & the far superior Lobste.rs, provided you are capable of interpreting the information using sound information literacy (skills which do not come easy & take multiple dozens of years to cultivate). So, as w/ most things in life, not True, but still useful...
