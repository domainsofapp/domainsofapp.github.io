Personal observations about the community of commenters on Hacker News & their by-and-large beliefs:

- Anti-alcohol/anti-drugs
- Pro-capitalism
- Sometimes pro-libertarian; very "Silicon Valley", i.e., pro-Si Valley tech mind (Y Combinator case in point)/pro- tech will save the world, not end it
- Pro-life/pro-kids/anti-Malthus (anti- population is too high)
- Pro-"Eastern" fake (non-scientific) medicine (stress kills; reduce stress via meditation, recalibrate your mind, etc.)
- Religious (Christian)/pro-G0d/pro-Jesus
- Pro-nuclear (pro-baseload)/anti-renewables (anti-intermittent)
- Anti-cryptocurrency/anti-blockchain
- Pro-social media/anti-censorship, but anti- spending time on social media (despite spending time & participating on the Hacker News social media website)


Overall, extremely socially conservative and often ideological & hypocritical. But, just like all social media commenters anywhere ever, they still think they're all brilliant & that they're certainly accurate & correct about their ideas & opinions (& that their community is certainly the best...i.e., self-congratulatory). Of course, none of this is intended to pass judgment on these observations. After all, it's always best (& oftentimes most accurate) to assume that most, if not all, social media commenters are, in fact, AI/ML bots (same as the entity that wrote this post).
