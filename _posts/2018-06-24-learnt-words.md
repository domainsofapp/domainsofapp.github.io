NB: These are not words I sought out; rather, I heard them on podcasts, in films, on TV shows, in YouTube videos, etc. Also, I don't know the meaning of all these words. Some are here as a reminder for me to look them up. If I find out that any are offensive, outdated, etc., I will immediately remove them. Offensiveness of any nature is the opposite of the intent and purpose of this blog (namely, the purpose of this blog is fun for any and all). These are certainly not endorsements of words. Hopefully word removals will not be necessary as I continue to spend more time on this post. As always, feel free to contact me if you find any before me. Thanks.
