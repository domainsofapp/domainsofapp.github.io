This is a test. This is only...a test.

This blog is intended to eventually host files (or links to files) of the following types:

* Audio
* GIF
* Image
* Meme
* Podcast
* Radio
* Text
* Video


If you would like to provide content, comments, feedback, or suggestions, you may reach me at:

domainsofapp at gee male

Or, if you would like to contribute programmatically/logistically to the site, here are the items on my to-do list:

* Add viewer counter (I scrapped Google Analytics b/c it weighs down the website and feels like an invasion of privacy and basic human rights)
* Add commenting features to the posts (e.g., Disqus)
* Add donations button so I can earn income (ha), make it my job, and spend more time building out the site (I have several thousand items that are yet to be added)
* Convince Jason Kottke of Kottke Dot Org to hire me to be his Internet filter blogging protégé


Finally, as the Internet is a fickle beast, please point out any broken links to me. Thanks for reading.

P.S. Please click the "Fork me on GitHub" ribbon in the upper right, fork the GitHub repository, replace my content, create your own blog, email me the link, and continue to pay it forward! This was my original intent (for this minimalist and free setup to spread). Thanks again :--)
