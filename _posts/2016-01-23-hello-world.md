This is a test. This is only...a test.

This blog is intended to eventually host files (or links to files) of the following types:
* Audio
* GIF
* Image
* Meme
* Podcast
* Radio
* Text
* Video

If you would like to provide content/comments/feedback/suggestions, you may reach me at:

domainsofapp at gee male

If you would like to contribute logistically to the site, here are the items on my to-do list:

* Add viewer counter (I scrapped Google Analytics b/c weighs down the website and feels like an invasion of privacy / basic human rights)
* Add commenting features to the posts (e.g., Disqus)
* Add advertisements or donations button so I can earn income (ha), make it a part-time job, and spend more time on the site

Finally, as the Internet is a fickle beast, please point out any broken links to me. Thanks for reading.

P.S. Please click the "Fork me on GitHub" ribbon in the upper right, fork the GitHub repository, replace my content, create your own blog, email me the link, and continue to pay it forward! This was my original intent (for this minimalist and free setup to spread). Thanks again :--)
