This is a test. This is only...a test.

Just kidding! It is not a test!

Just kidding. It is a test.

This blog is intended to eventually host files (or links to files) of the following types:
* Audio
* GIF
* Image
* Meme
* Podcast
* Radio
* Text
* Video

If you would like to provide content/comments/feedback/suggestions, you may reach me at:

domainsofapp at gee male

If you would like to contribute logistically to the site, I am open to that. Here are some items on my to-do list:

* Add Google Analytics
* Add commenting features to the posts (e.g., Disqus)
* Add advertisements so I can earn some income from this and make it my part-time job ;--)

Finally, as the Internet is a fickle beast, please point out any broken links to me. Thanks for reading!
