This is a test. This is only...a test.

This blog is intended to eventually host files (or links to files) of the following types:
* Audio
* GIF
* Image
* Meme
* Podcast
* Radio
* Text
* Video

If you would like to provide content/comments/feedback/suggestions, you may reach me at:

domainsofapp at gee male

If you would like to contribute logistically to the site, I am open to that. Here are some items on my to-do list:

* Add Google Analytics
* Add commenting features to the posts (e.g., Disqus)
* Add advertisements or donations button so I can earn income from this, make it a part-time job, and spend more time on the site

Finally, as the Internet is a fickle beast, please point out any broken links to me. Thanks for reading.

P.S. "Fork me on GitHub" and replace my content to create your own blog and then please email me the link and pay it forward! Thanks again ;--)
