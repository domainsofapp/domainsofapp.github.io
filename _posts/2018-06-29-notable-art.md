I have encountered much great art in my life but have not recorded a ledger.

The following is notable art that I have recently encountered:

The Death of Marat -- Jacques-Louis David  

And what I immediately recall is good:

Edvard Munch  
Frida Kahlo  
Vincent van Gogh  

Not good (ha!):

Jackson Pollack
