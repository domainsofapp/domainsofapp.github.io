# TODO domainsofapp.github.io
1. Verify all links on site (automate process?).
2. Add slash mark "/" to end of every link if it doesn't break link (or remove all slashes? Figure out best practice and implement).
3. Verify correct dates and alphabetical orders.
4. Widen screen for phones and increase text size.
5. Automate entire blog posting process.
6. Demarcate music album vs. song on HTML index page vs. entry in Notable Songs post.
7. Verify spelling and grammar.
8. Add view counter to site (for general curiosity & interest's sake).
9. Establish a favicon ICO for the blog. (Go to site and click "F12" and click around, and you'll see the error pop up in the developer dev tools.)
10. Relabel what is "audio" vs. "video", etc.
